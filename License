**Next Steps:**

1. **Test Locally:**  
   - Run `node app.js add "My first note"` and then `node app.js list` to see if it works.
   - Remove a note with `node app.js remove "My first note"` and list again to confirm it’s gone.

2. **Push to GitHub:**  
   Commit and push the files to a repository named `node-notes`.

3. **Link from Your Portfolio:**  
   Since this is a CLI app, you’ll provide “View Code” links to the GitHub repository. You can also include a screenshot of the terminal output in the `README.md` if you wish.

This project showcases back-end logic, file I/O, and CLI manipulation using Node.js, adding a versatile skill to your portfolio.
